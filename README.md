# PennyPlanner

Expense tracking and budget management in PennyPlanner.

Project Description:

PennyPlanner is a user-friendly application designed to help students meticulously monitor their expenditures through personalised categories. This tool empowers users to effortlessly manage their budgets, paving the way for them to achieve their savings objectives.
This application was developed using the PyCharm integrated development environment (IDE). The primary challenge encountered revolved around ensuring the user-friendliness of the application and making the code easily understandable for third parties. Looking ahead, our aspirations include integrating a robust user interface with enhanced functionalities and increased personalization.

How to Install and Run the Project:

To execute the project, place the code into an integrated development environment (IDE) such as PyCharm or Colab, install the required packages, and run the application.
