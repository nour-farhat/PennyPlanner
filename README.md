# Project Name - PennyPlanner

Expense tracking and budget management in PennyPlanner.

# Project Description:

PennyPlanner is a user-friendly application designed to help students meticulously monitor their expenditures through personalised categories. This tool empowers users to effortlessly manage their budgets, paving the way for them to achieve their savings objectives.
This application was developed using the PyCharm integrated development environment (IDE). The primary challenge encountered revolved around ensuring the user-friendliness of the application and making the code easily understandable for third parties. Looking ahead, our aspirations include integrating a robust user interface with enhanced functionalities and increased personalization.

# Installation:

To be able to run our program, make sure you have the following elements installed:

  - Python programming language or online IDE environment such as Google Colab - It will work in all versions between 3.6 and 3.8. 
  - Libraries - In order to run our program, we make use of the following library: matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
        To download the library type the following command:   
    ```pip install matplotlib ``` 
  
  Now that we have the required library set up, open the file named Code, copy the code, paste it in an IDE and run the program. 

# Usage:

After a user enters our platform:

1) They will be welcomed and asked for their monthly budget (users will not be able to enter a number lower or equal to 0).
 

2) Customized categories and allocation amounts: Users will be prompted to input their chosen personalized category and the desired monetary allocation for that category. Upon completion of category creation, users can signify completion by entering "done."


3) Visualization of user's budget: After completing the previous steps, users will encounter a pie chart illustrating the distribution of their allocated funds among various categories. Additionally, an automated savings category will be generated, displaying the amount saved if the total budget was not fully allocated.


4) Expense tracking and history: Finally, users will be prompted to input their expenses within the designated category they created, and they will receive an overview of their expense history. Users will need to input the name of a category they have created and the corresponding expense amount.

# SOME EXTRA INFORMATION ABOUT THE CODE
In order to carry out our objective, we have used the following data structures and algorithms:

  1. Hash Tables - Used to store all details regarding the opportunities
  2.  Dictionaries -Used to store budget information, where keys represent expense categories, and values represent the budget allocated to each category
  3. Lists
  4. Quicksort Algorithm
